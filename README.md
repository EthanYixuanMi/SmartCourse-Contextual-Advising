## 🔍 Overview

SmartCourse is a university course management and AI-driven advising system that provides personalized course recommendations based on a student's transcript and degree plan. This repository is an enhanced version of our original course project, extended for research and evaluation purposes.

> This project is based on the original coursework project:  
> [CS-Course-Project-in-Wenzhou-Kean-University/CPS3320](https://github.com/EthanYixuanMi/CS-Course-Project-in-Wenzhou-Kean-University/tree/main/CPS3320)


## ✨ New in This Version

This research version expands the original project with:
- 📊 Experimental evaluation on 25 advising queries
- 🎯 Novel contextual prompts integrating transcripts and four-year plans
- 🧠 Local LLM (via Ollama) for context-aware recommendations
- 📐 Custom metrics: `PlanScore`, `PersonalScore`, `Lift`, and `Recall`
- 🧪 Context ablation experiments comparing 4 modes (full, no transcript, no plan, question-only)


## 🧠 How It Works

SmartCourse supports three user roles:
![System Architecture](assets/SmartCourse_arch.png)  
*Fig. 1. SmartCourse system architecture. Users interact via CLI or Gradio GUI; recommendations are generated by a local LLM. This figure corresponds to Fig. 1 in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/xxxx.xxxxx).*


- **Student**: Enroll/drop courses, view grades, and request AI suggestions
- **Instructor**: Assign grades and review student enrollment
- **Administrator**: Manage course catalog and switch LLM models


All interactions can happen through:
- ✅ Command-Line Interface (CLI)
- 🌐 Gradio-based GUI


The AI Advising Module uses structured prompts that combine:  
[Transcript]()  
[Degree Plan]()  
[Student Question]()  
to provide personalized suggestions via a local LLM (e.g., LLaMA3.1:8B through Ollama).

## 🛠 Installation

### 🔧 Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Gradio, Requests

```bash
pip install gradio requests
```

## 📁 Project Structure

The following files are required to run the system end-to-end (via CLI or GUI):  
`data/account.txt`, `data/course_list.txt`, `data/cps_plan.txt`, `main_frame/main.py`, and `main_frame/ui_gradio.py`.

## ▶️ Running the App
CLI:
```bash
python main.py
```

GUI (Gradio):
```bash
python ui_gradio.py
```


## AI Integration (via Ollama)

![AI Advising Example](assets/ai_advice.png)  
*Fig. 2. Sample LLM response based on transcript and degree plan. This figure corresponds to Fig. 2 in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/xxxx.xxxxx).*  

1. Install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/download)
2. Set model path as environment variable (for Windows):
```bash
setx OLLAMA_MODELS "D:\ollama_models" /M
```
3. Pull your model:
```bash
ollama pull llama3.1:8b
```

## 📊 Experimental Results

We evaluated SmartCourse on 25 representative advising queries across four context conditions, as described in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/xxxx.xxxxx). The table below corresponds to Table I.

| Mode          | #Rec | PlanScore | PersonalScore | Lift | Recall | Latency (s) |
| ------------- |------|-----------|----------------|------|--------|-------------|
| Full Context  | **6.56** | 0.53      | **0.78**       | **0.25** | 0.15   | 47.65       |
| No Plan       | 2.24 | 0.03      | 0.19           | 0.16 | 0.01   | 25.36       |
| No Transcript | 6.20 | **0.60**  | 0.69           | 0.09 | **0.17** | 34.34       |
| Question Only | 0.04 | 0.04      | 0.04           | 0.00 | 0.00   | 21.52       |
